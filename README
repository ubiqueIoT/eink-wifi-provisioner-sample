# Provisioning ESP32 WiFi Enabled Projects using Soft AP and an E-Ink Display

This project uses an [ESP32 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400) and an [E-Ink FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4195). It will display the device's Soft AP connection details in the form of a QR code on the display. The code can be scanned with the [ESP32 Soft AP app](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/esp-softap-provisioning/id1474040630) to quickly connect and set up the device's network credentials.
